# Traveling Salesman Problem using Genetic Algorithm
The goal of this project is to find the shortest possible path connecting a set of cities, where each city is visited only once, and the journey ends in the starting city. 
We are looking for the shortest distance between 2 cities and the order of visiting the cities (combinatorial problem). 
The problem was solved with the help of a genetic algorithm.
